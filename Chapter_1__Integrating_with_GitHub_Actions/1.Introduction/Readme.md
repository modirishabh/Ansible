# Integrating Ansible with GitHub Actions

## Course Overview
Welcome to this course on Integrating Ansible with GitHub Actions by Henry Been. This course addresses the common limitations of running Ansible locally and demonstrates how to leverage GitHub Actions for more efficient automation.

## Why Use GitHub Actions with Ansible?

### Limitations of Local Ansible Execution
- **Version Control Issues**: Difficult to track who's working on what
- **Collaboration Challenges**: Sharing playbooks within teams becomes complex
- **Access Requirements**: Need direct access to servers or Ansible Vault passwords
- **Scheduling Limitations**: Cannot easily run playbooks repetitively or on schedule

### Benefits of GitHub Actions Integration
- ✅ **Source Control**: All playbooks managed through Git
- ✅ **Dedicated Runners**: Eliminate the need for local control nodes
- ✅ **Automated Execution**: Run playbooks on every change or on schedule
- ✅ **Built-in Testing**: Automate linting and testing of playbooks
