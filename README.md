# Ansible
welcome to my course, Integrating Ansible with GitHub Actions.Some of the major topics that we will cover include an introduction to GitHub source control for storing Ansible files and how you can benefit from that, building an initial workflow for linting Ansible files whenever a new change comes in and preventing incorrect playbooks from being committed, extending that workflow to deploy a playbook to multiple environments like test and production, the importance of secret management and how to implement that when using GitHub Actions, and how you can combine the use of Ansible Vault with GitHub Actions. By the end of this course, you will know enough about GitHub Actions to have a solid foundation for using actions to deploy your own Ansible playbooks. So I really hope you will join me on this journey to learn how to integrate Ansible with GitHub Actions
